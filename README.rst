If you want to see it running, clone the repo and start a local web server. For example, you can run Python's built-in server:

.. code:: bash

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &

or Node.js' http-server_:

.. code:: bash

    http-server -p 8888 &

Once this is running, go to http://localhost:8888/ and use the **up** and **down** keys to change between days, and the **left** and **right** keys to move between hours.
